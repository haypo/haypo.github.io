</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I added functions to the private &quot;pytime&quot; library to convert timestamps from/to
various formats. I expected to spend a few days, at the end I spent 3 years
(2012-2015) on them!</p>
<div class="section" id="python-3-3">
<h2>Python 3.3</h2>
<p>In 2012, I proposed the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0410/">PEP 410 -- Use decimal.Decimal type for timestamps</a> because storing timestamps as
floating point numbers looses precision. The PEP was rejected because it
modified many functions and had a bad API. At least, os.stat() got 3 new fields
(atime_ns, mtime_ns, ctime_ns): timestamps  as a number of nanoseconds
(<tt class="docutils literal">int</tt>).</p>
<p>My <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0418/">PEP 418 -- Add monotonic time, performance counter, and process time
functions</a> was accepted, Python
3.3 got a new <tt class="docutils literal">time.monotonic()</tt> function (and a few others). Again, I spent
much more time than I expected on a problem which looked simple at the first
look.</p>
<p>With the <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.python.org/issue14180">issue #14180</a>, I added functions
to convert timestamps to the private &quot;pytime&quot; API to factorize the code of
various modules. Timestamps were rounded towards +infinity (ROUND_CEILING), but
it was not a deliberate choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-3-4">
<h2>Python 3.4</h2>
<p>To fix correctly a performance issue in asyncio (<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue20311">issue20311</a>), I added two rounding modes to the
pytime API: _PyTime_ROUND_DOWN (round towards zero), and _PyTime_ROUND_UP
(round away from zero). Polling for events (ex: using <tt class="docutils literal">select.select()</tt>) with
a non-zero timestamp must not call the underlying C level in non-blocking mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-3-5">
<h2>Python 3.5</h2>
<p>When working on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue22117">issue #22117</a>, I
noticed that the implementation of rounding methods was buggy for negative
timestamps. I replaced the _PyTime_ROUND_DOWN with _PyTime_ROUND_FLOOR (round
towards minus infinity), and _PyTime_ROUND_UP with _PyTime_ROUND_CEILING (round
towards infinity).</p>
<p>This issue also introduced a new private <tt class="docutils literal">_PyTime_t</tt> type to support
nanosecond resolution.  The type is an opaque integer type to store timestamps.
In practice, it's a signed 64-bit integer. Since it's an integer, it's easy and
natural to compute the sum or differecence of two timestamps: <tt class="docutils literal">t1 + t2</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">t2 - t1</tt>. I added _PyTime_XXX() functions to create a timestamp and
_PyTime_AsXXX() functions to convert a timestamp to a different format.</p>
<p>I had to keep three _PyTime_ObjectToXXX() functions for fromtimestamp() methods
of the datetime module. These methods must support extreme timestamps (year
1..9999), whereas _PyTime_t is &quot;limited&quot; to a delta of +/- 292 years (year
1678..2262).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-3-6">
<h2>Python 3.6</h2>
<p>In 2015, the <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.python.org/issue23517">issue #23517</a> reported that
Python 2 and Python 3 don't use the same rounding method in
datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(): there was a difference of 1 microsecond.</p>
<p>After a long discussion, I modified fromtimestamp() methods of the datetime
module to round to nearest with ties going away from zero (ROUND_HALF_UP), as
done in Python 2.7, as round() in all Python versions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It took me three years to stabilize the API and fix all issues. Well, I didn't
spend all my days on it, but it shows that handling time is not a simple issue.</p>
<p>At the Python level, nothing changed, timestamps are still stored as float
(except of the 3 new fieleds of os.stat()).</p>
<p>Python 3.5 only supports timezones with fixed offset, it does not support the
locale timestamp for example. Timezones are still an hot topic: the
<a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/datetime-sig">datetime-sig mailing list</a> was created to
enhance timezone support in Python.</p>
