Since Python 3.0 was released in 2008, each time an user reported an encoding
issue, someone showed up and asked why Python does not "simply" always use UTF-8.
Well, it's not that easy. **UTF-8 is the best encoding in most cases, but it is
still not the best encoding in all cases**, even in 2018. The locale encoding
remains the best default filesystem encoding for Python. I would say that **the
locale encoding is the least bad filesystem encoding**.

This article tells the story of my `PEP 540: Add a new UTF-8 Mode
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0540/>`_ which adds an opt-in option to
**"use UTF-8" everywhere"**. Moreover, the UTF-8 Mode is enabled by the POSIX
locale: **Python 3.7 now uses UTF-8 for the POSIX locale**. My
PEP 540 is complementary to Nick Coghlan's PEP 538.

When I started to write this article, I wrote something like: "Hey! I added a
new option to use UTF-8, enjoy!". Written like that, it seems like using UTF-8
was an obvious choice and that it was really easy to write such PEP. No.
**Nothing was obvious, nothing was simple.**

It took me one year to design and implement my PEP 540, and to get it accepted.
I wrote five articles before this one to show that the PEP 540 only came after
a long painful journey, starting with Python 3.0, to choose the best Python
encoding.  My PEP rely on the all the great work done previously.

**This article is the sixth and last in a series of articles telling the
history and rationale of the Python 3 Unicode model for the operating system:**

* 1. `Python 3.0 listdir() Bug on Undecodable Filenames <{filename}/python30_listdir.rst>`_
* 2. `Python 3.1 surrogateescape error handler (PEP 383) <{filename}/pep383.rst>`_
* 3. `Python 3.2 Painful History of the Filesystem Encoding <{filename}/fs_encoding.rst>`_
* 4. `Python 3.6 now uses UTF-8 on Windows <{filename}/windows_utf8.rst>`_
* 5. `Python 3.7 and the POSIX locale <{filename}/posix_locale.rst>`_
* 6. `Python 3.7 UTF-8 Mode <{filename}/utf8_mode.rst>`_

Fallback to UTF-8 if getting the locale encoding fails?
=======================================================

May 2010, I reported `bpo-8610 <https://bugs.python.org/issue8610>`__:
"Python3/POSIX:  errors if file system encoding is None". I asked what should
be the default encoding when getting the locale encoding fails. I proposed
to fallback to UTF-8. `I wrote <https://bugs.python.org/issue8610#msg105008>`__:

    **UTF-8 is also an optimist choice**: I bet that more and more operating
    systems will move to UTF-8.

`Marc-Andre commented <https://bugs.python.org/issue8610#msg105010>`_:

    Ouch, that was a poor choice. **In Python we have a tradition to avoid
    guessing**, if possible. Since we cannot guarantee that the file system
    will indeed use UTF-8, it would have been safer to use ASCII. Not sure why
    this reasoning wasn't applied for the file system encoding.

In practice, Python already used UTF-8 when the filesystem encoding was set to
``None``. I pushed the `commit b744ba1d
<https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b744ba1d14c5487576c95d0311e357b707600b47>`__
into the Python 3.2 development branch to make the default encoding (UTF-8)
more obvious. But before Python 3.2 was released, I removed the fallback with
my `commit e474309b
<https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/e474309bb7f0ba6e6ae824c215c45f00db691889>`__
(Oct 2010):

    ``initfsencoding()``: ``get_codeset()`` failure is now a fatal error

    Don't fallback to UTF-8 anymore to avoid mojibake. I never got any error
    from his function.

The utf8 option proposed for Windows
====================================

August 2016, `bpo-27781 <https://bugs.python.org/issue27781>`__: when **Steve
Dower** `was working on changing the filesystem encoding to UTF-8
<{filename}/windows_utf8.rst>`__, I was not sure that Windows should use UTF-8
by default. I was more in favor on **making the backward incompatible change an
opt-in option**. `I wrote <https://bugs.python.org/issue27781#msg272950>`__:

    **If you go in this direction, I would like to follow you for the UNIX/BSD
    side to make the switch portable. I was thinking about "-X utf8" which
    avoids to change the command line parser.**

    If we agree on a plan, **I would like to write it down as a PEP since I
    expect a lot of complains and questions which I would prefer to only answer
    once** (see for example the length of your thread on python-ideas where
    each people repeated the same things multiple times ;-))

`I added <https://bugs.python.org/issue27781#msg272962>`__:

    I mean that ``python3 -X utf8`` should force
    ``sys.getfilesystemencoding()`` to UTF-8 on UNIX/BSD, it would ignore the
    current locale setting.

Since Steve chose to **change the default to UTF-8** on Windows, my ``-X utf8``
option idea was ignored in this issue.

The utf8 option proposed for the POSIX locale
=============================================

September 2016: **Jan Niklas Hasse** opened `bpo-28180
<https://bugs.python.org/issue28180>`__ about Docker images,
**"sys.getfilesystemencoding() should default to utf-8"**.

`I proposed again my option <https://bugs.python.org/issue28180#msg276707>`__:

    I proposed to add ``-X utf8`` command line option for UNIX to force utf8
    encoding. Would it work for you?

**Jan Niklas Hasse** `answered
<https://bugs.python.org/issue28180#msg276709>`_:

    Unfortunately no, as this would mean I'll have to change all my python
    invocations in my scripts and it wouldn't work for executable files with

December 2016, `I added <https://bugs.python.org/issue28180#msg283408>`__:

    Usually, when a new option is added to Python, we add a command line option
    (-X utf8) but also an environment variable: **I propose PYTHONUTF8=1**.

    Use your favorite method to define the env var "system wide" in your docker
    containers.

    Note: Technically, I'm not sure that it's possible to support -E option
    with PYTHONUTF8, since -E comes from the command line, and we first need to
    decode command line arguments with an encoding to parse these options....
    Chicken-and-egg issue ;-)

**Nick Coghlan** `wrote his PEP 538 "Coercing the C locale to a UTF-8 based
locale" <{filename}/posix_locale.rst>`__ which has been approved in May 2017
and finally implemented in June 2017.

Again, my utf8 idea was ignored in this issue.

First version of my PEP 540: Add a new UTF-8 Mode
=================================================

January 2017, as a follow-up of `bpo-27781
<https://bugs.python.org/issue27781>`__ and `bpo-28180
<https://bugs.python.org/issue28180>`__, I wrote the `PEP 540: Add a new UTF-8
Mode <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0540/>`_ and `I posted it to
python-ideas for comments
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2017-January/044089.html>`_.

Abstract:

    Add a new UTF-8 mode, opt-in option to use UTF-8 for operating system
    data instead of the locale encoding. Add ``-X utf8`` command line option
    and ``PYTHONUTF8`` environment variable.

After ten hours after and a few messages, I `wrote a second version
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2017-January/044099.html>`_:

    I modified my PEP: **the POSIX locale now enables the UTF-8 mode**.

**INADA Naoki** `wrote
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2017-January/044112.html>`_:

    I want UTF-8 mode is **enabled by default (opt-out option) even if locale
    is not POSIX**, like `PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING`.

    Users depends on locale know what locale is and how to configure it.  They
    can understand difference between locale mode and UTF-8 mode and they can
    opt-out UTF-8 mode.

    **But many people lives in "UTF-8 everywhere" world**, and don't know about
    locale.

Always ignoring the locale to **always use UTF-8 would be a backward
incompatible change**. I wasn't brave enough to propose it, I only
wanted to propose an opt-in option, except of the specific case of the POSIX
locale.

Not only people had different opinons, but most people had strong opinions on
how to handle Unicode and were not ready for compromises.

Third version of my PEP 540
===========================

One week and 59 emails later, I `implemented my PEP 540
<https://bugs.python.org/issue29240>`__ and `I wrote a third version of my PEP
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2017-January/044197.html>`_:

    I made multiple changes since the first version of my PEP:

    * The **UTF-8 Strict mode now only uses strict for inputs and outputs**:
      it keeps surrogateescape for operating system data. Read the "Use the
      strict error handler for operating system data" alternative for the
      rationale.

    * The POSIX locale now enables the UTF-8 mode. See the "Don't modify
      the encoding of the POSIX locale" alternative for the rationale.

    * Specify the priority between -X utf8, PYTHONUTF8, PYTHONIOENCODING, etc.

    The PEP version 3 has a longer rationale with more example. (...)

The new thread also got 19 emails, total: **78 emails in one month**. The same
month, Nick Coghlan's PEP 538 was also under discussion.

Silence during one year
=======================

Because of the tone of the python-ideas threads and because I didn't know how
to deal with Nick Coghlan's PEP 538, **I decided to do nothing during one
year** (January to December 2017).

April 2017, Nick `proposed
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-April/147795.html>`__
**INADA Naoki** as the BDFL Delegate for his PEP 538 and my PEP 540. Guido
`accepted to delegate
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-April/147796.html>`_.

May 2017, Naoki approved Nick's PEP 538, and Nick implemented it.

PEP 540 version 3 posted to python-dev
======================================

At the end of 2017, when I looked at my contributions in Python 3.7 in the
`What’s New In Python 3.7 <https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.7.html>`_
document, I didn't see any significant contribution. I wanted to propose
something. Moreover, the deadline for the Python 3.7 feature freeze (first beta
version) was getting close, end of January 2018: see the `PEP 537: Python 3.7
Release Schedule <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/>`_.

December 2017, I decided to move to the next step: `I sent my PEP to the
python-dev mailing list
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151054.html>`_.

Guido van Rossum `complained about the length of the PEP
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151069.html>`_:

    I've been discussing this PEP offline with Victor, but he suggested we
    should discuss it in public instead.

    **I am very worried about this long and rambling PEP, and I propose that it
    not be accepted without a major rewrite to focus on clarity of the
    specification. The "Unicode just works" summary is more a wish than a
    proper summary of the PEP.**

    (...)

    So I guess PEP acceptance week is over. :-(

PEP rewritten from scratch
==========================

Even if **I was not fully convinced myself that my PEP was a good idea**, I
wanted to get an official vote, to know if my idea should be implemented or
abandonned. I decided to rewrite my PEP from scratch:

* `PEP version 3 (before rewrite)
  <https://github.com/python/peps/blob/f92b5fbdc2bcd9b182c1541da5a0f4ce32195fb6/pep-0540.txt>`_:
  1,017 lines
* `PEP version 4 (after rewrite)
  <https://github.com/python/peps/blob/0bb19ff93af9855db327e9a02f3e86b6f932a25a/pep-0540.txt>`_:
  263 lines (26% of the previous version)

I reduced the rationale to the strict minimum, to explain **key points** of the
PEP:

* Locale encoding and UTF-8
* Passthough undecodable bytes: surrogateescape
* Strict UTF-8 for correctness
* No change by default for best backward compatibility

Reading JPEG pictures with surrogateescape
==========================================

December 2017, I sent the `shorter PEP version 4 to python-dev
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151074.html>`_.

INADA Naoki, the BDFL-delegate, `spotted a design issue
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151081.html>`_:

    And I have one worrying point. With UTF-8 mode, **open()'s default**
    encoding/error handler **is UTF-8/surrogateescape**.

    (...)

    And **opening binary file without "b" option is very common mistake** of
    new developers.  If default error handler is surrogateescape, **they lose a
    chance to notice their bug**.

He `gave a concrete example
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151101.html>`_:

    With PEP 538 (C.UTF-8 locale), ``open()`` uses UTF-8/strict, not
    UTF-8/surrogateescape.

    For example, this code raises ``UnicodeDecodeError`` with PEP 538 if the
    file is JPEG file. ::

        with open(fn) as f:
            f.read()

`I replied <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151132.html>`__:

    While I'm not strongly convinced that ``open()`` error handler must be
    changed for ``surrogateescape``, first **I would like to make sure that
    it's really a very bad idea** before changing it :-)

    (...)

    Using a JPEG image, the example is obviously wrong.

    But using surrogateescape on open() has been chosen to **read text files
    which are mostly correctly encoded to UTF-8, except a few bytes**.

    I'm not sure how to explain the issue. The Mercurial wiki page has a good
    example of this issue that they call the `"Makefile problem"
    <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EncodingStrategy#The_.22makefile_problem.22>`_.

**Guido van Rossum** `finished to convinced me
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151134.html>`_:

    You will quickly get decoding errors, and that is **INADA**'s point.
    (Unless you use ``encoding='Latin-1'``.) His worry is that the
    surrogateescape error handler makes it so that you won't get decoding
    errors, and then **the failure mode is much harder to debug**.

I `wrote a 5th version of my PEP
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151136.html>`_:

    I made the following two changes to the PEP 540:

    * open() error handler remains ``"strict"``
    * Remove the "Strict UTF8 mode" which doesn't make much sense anymore

Last question on locale.getpreferredencoding()
==============================================

December 2017, **INADA Naoki** `asked
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151144.html>`_:

    Or ``locale.getpreferredencoding()`` returns ``'UTF-8'`` in UTF-8 mode too?

Oh, that's a good question! I `looked at the code
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151148.html>`_ and
agreed to return UTF-8:

    I checked the stdlib, and I found many places where
    ``locale.getpreferredencoding()`` is used to get the user preferred
    encoding:

    * builtin ``open()``: default encoding
    * ``cgi.FieldStorage``: encode the query string
    * ``encoding._alias_mbcs()``: check if the requested encoding is the ANSI
      code page
    * ``gettext.GNUTranslations``: ``lgettext()`` and ``lngettext()`` methods
    * ``xml.etree.ElementTree``: ``ElementTree.write(encoding='unicode')``

    In the UTF-8 mode, I would expect that cgi, gettext and xml.etree all use
    the UTF-8 encoding by default. So **locale.getpreferredencoding() should
    return UTF-8 if the UTF-8 mode is enabled**.

I `sent a 6th version of my PEP
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151151.html>`_:

    locale.getpreferredencoding() now returns 'UTF-8' in the UTF-8 Mode.

Moreover, I also wrote a new much better written "Relationship with the locale
coercion (PEP 538)" section replacing the "Annex: Differences between
PEP 538 and PEP 540" section. The new section was asked by many people who were
confused by the relationship between PEP 538 and PEP 540.

Finally, one year after the first PEP version, INADA Naoki `approved my PEP
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151193.html>`_!

First incomplete implementation
===============================

I started to work on the implementation of my PEP 540 in March 2017. Once the
PEP has been approved, I asked INADA Naoki for a review. `He asked me to fix the
command line parsing
<https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/855#issuecomment-351089573>`_ to handle
properly the ``-X utf8`` option:

    And when ``-X utf8`` option is found, we can decode from ``char **argv``
    again.  Since ``mbstowcs()`` doesn't guarantee round tripping, it is better
    than re-encode ``wchar_t **argv``.

Implementing properly the ``-X utf8`` option was tricky. Parsing the command line
was done on ``wchar_t*`` C strings (Unicode), which requires to decode the
``char** argv`` C array of byte strings (bytes). Python starts by decoding byte
strings from the locale encoding. If the utf8 option is detected, ``argv`` byte
strings must be decoded again, but now from UTF-8. The problem was that the
code was not designed for that, and it required to refactor a lot of code in
``Py_Main()``.

`I replied
<https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/855#issuecomment-351252873>`__:

    ``main()`` and ``Py_Main()`` are very complex. With the `PEP 432
    <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0432/>`_, **Nick Coghlan**, **Eric
    Snow** and me are working on making this code better. See for example
    `bpo-32030 <https://bugs.python.org/issue32030>`_.

    (...)

    For all these reasons, **I propose to merge this uncomplete PR and write a
    different PR for the most complex part**, re-encode wchar_t* command line
    arguments, implement Py_UnixMain() or another even better option?

I wanted to get my code merged as soon as possible to make sure that it will
get into the first Python 3.7 beta, to get a longer testing period before
Python 3.7 final.

December 2017, `bpo-29240 <https://bugs.python.org/issue29240>`__, I pushed my
`commit 91106cd9
<https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/91106cd9ff2f321c0f60fbaa09fd46c80aa5c266>`__:

    PEP 540: Add a new UTF-8 Mode

    * Add ``-X utf8`` command line option, ``PYTHONUTF8`` environment variable
      and a new ``sys.flags.utf8_mode`` flag.
    * ``locale.getpreferredencoding()`` now returns 'UTF-8' in the UTF-8
      mode. As a side effect, open() now uses the UTF-8 encoding by
      default in this mode.

Split Py_Main() into subfunctions
=================================

November 2017, I created `bpo-32030 <https://bugs.python.org/issue32030>`__ to
split the big ``Py_Main()`` function into smaller subfunctions. My motivation
was to be able to properly implement my PEP 540.

It will take me **3 months of work and 45 commits** to completely cleanup
``Py_Main()`` and put almost all Python configuration options into the private
C ``_PyCoreConfig`` structure.

Parse again the command line when -X utf8 is used
=================================================

December 2017, `bpo-32030 <https://bugs.python.org/issue32030>`__, thanks to
the ``Py_Main()`` refactoring, I was able to finish the implementation of my
PEP.

I pushed my `commit 9454060e <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9454060e84a669dde63824d9e2fcaf295e34f687>`__:

    ``Py_Main()`` re-reads config if encoding changes

    If the encoding change (C locale coerced or UTF-8 Mode changed),
    ``Py_Main()`` now reads again the configuration with the new encoding.

If the encoding changed after reading the Python configuration, cleanup the
configuration and **read again the configuration with the new encoding.** The
key feature here allowed by the refactoring is to be able to cleanup properly
all the configuration.

UTF-8 Mode and the locale encoding
==================================

January 2018, while working on `bpo-31900
<https://bugs.python.org/issue31900>`__ "localeconv() should decode numeric
fields from LC_NUMERIC encoding, not from LC_CTYPE encoding", I tested various
combinations of locales and encodings. **I found bugs with the UTF-8 mode.**

When the UTF-8 mode is enabled explicitly by ``-X utf8``, the intent is to use
UTF-8 "everywhere". Right. But **there are some places, where the current
locale encoding is really the correct encoding**, like the ``time.strftime()``
function.

`bpo-29240 <https://bugs.python.org/issue29240>`__: I pushed a first fix,
`commit cb3ae558 <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/cb3ae5588bd7733e76dc09277bb7626652d9bb64>`__:

    Ignore UTF-8 Mode in the ``time`` module

    ``time.strftime()`` must use the current ``LC_CTYPE`` encoding, not UTF-8
    if the UTF-8 mode is enabled.

I tested more cases and found... **more bugs**. More functions must really use the
current locale encoding, rather than UTF-8 if the UTF-8 Mode is enabled.

I pushed a second fix, `commit 7ed7aead
<https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/7ed7aead9503102d2ed316175f198104e0cd674c>`__:

    Fix locale encodings in UTF-8 Mode

    Modify ``locale.localeconv()``, ``time.tzname``, ``os.strerror()`` and
    other functions to ignore the UTF-8 Mode: always use the current locale
    encoding.

The second fix documented the encoding used by the public C functions
`Py_DecodeLocale()
<https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/sys.html#c.Py_DecodeLocale>`_ and
`Py_EncodeLocale()
<https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/sys.html#c.Py_EncodeLocale>`_:

   Encoding, highest priority to lowest priority:

   * ``UTF-8`` on macOS and Android;
   * ``UTF-8`` if the Python UTF-8 mode is enabled;
   * ``ASCII`` if the ``LC_CTYPE`` locale is ``"C"``,
     ``nl_langinfo(CODESET)`` returns the ``ASCII`` encoding (or an alias),
     and ``mbstowcs()`` and ``wcstombs()`` functions uses the
     ``ISO-8859-1`` encoding.
   * the current locale encoding.

The fix was complex to be written because I had to extend Py_DecodeLocale() and
Py_EncodeLocale() to support internally the ``strict`` error handler. I also
extended to API to report an error message (called "reason") on failure.

For example, ``Py_DecodeLocale()`` has the prototype::

    wchar_t*
    Py_DecodeLocale(const char* arg, size_t *wlen)

whereas the new extended and more generic ``_Py_DecodeLocaleEx()`` has a much
more complex prototype::

    int
    _Py_DecodeLocaleEx(const char* arg, wchar_t **wstr, size_t *wlen,
                       const char **reason,
                       int current_locale, int surrogateescape)

To decode, there are two main use cases:

* (FILENAME) Use UTF-8 if the UTF-8 Mode is enabled, or the locale encoding
  otherwise. See ``Py_DecodeLocale()`` documentation for the exact used
  encoding, the truth is more complex.
* (LOCALE) Always use the current locale encoding

(FILENAME) examples:

* ``Py_DecodeLocale()``, ``PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefaultAndSize()``: use the
  ``surrogateescape`` error handler
* ``os.fsdecode()``
* ``os.listdir()``
* ``os.environ``
* ``sys.argv``
* etc.

(LOCALE) examples:

* ``PyUnicode_DecodeLocale()``: the error handler is passed as an argument and
  must be ``strict`` or ``surrogateescape``
* ``time.strftime()``
* ``locale.localeconv()``
* ``time.tzname``
* ``os.strerror()``
* ``readline`` module: internal ``decode()`` function
* etc.


Summary of PEP 540 history
==========================

* Version 1: first version sent to python-ideas
* Version 2: the POSIX locale now enables the UTF-8 mode
* Version 3: the UTF-8 Strict mode now only uses the ``strict`` error handler
  for inputs and outputs
* Version 4: PEP rewritten from scratch to be shorter
* Version 5: open() error handler remains ``strict``, and the "Strict UTF8
  mode" has been removed
* Version 6: locale.getpreferredencoding() now returns 'UTF-8' in the UTF-8
  Mode.

Abstract of the final approved PEP:

    Add a new "UTF-8 Mode" to enhance Python's use of UTF-8.  When UTF-8 Mode
    is active, Python will:

    * use the ``utf-8`` encoding, irregardless of the locale currently set by
      the current platform, and
    * change the ``stdin`` and ``stdout`` error handlers to
      ``surrogateescape``.

    This mode is off by default, but is automatically activated when using
    the "POSIX" locale.

    Add the ``-X utf8`` command line option and ``PYTHONUTF8`` environment
    variable to control UTF-8 Mode.

Conclusion
==========

It's now time for a well deserved nap... until the next major Unicode issue in Python.
